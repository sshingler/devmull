# Getting useful information out of git log

A couple of weeks ago, this snippet was hitting the software twitterati in a big way

	git log --graph --pretty=format:'%an: %s - %Cred%h%Creset %C(yellow)%d%Creset %Cgreen(%cr)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative

It produces a very pretty tree view of the git log, piped into less.

It got me wondering what you could do with git log in terms of viewing the total number of commits by each author working on a repository. A league table of commits, if you will - although that isn't a metric of competition or status in any way. :)

Here's what I came up with:

	git log | grep 'Author:'| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

Here's the output of that command on the [github rails project](http://github.com/rails/rails/) (abridged)
